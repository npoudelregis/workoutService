# Workout App Backend Service

### Description
This app provides a backend service for a workout/fitness app. It provides the database and several endpoints for retrieving and manipulating data in the database.

### Deployment production/local

The live version of this app can be accessed at:
https://workoutservice.herokuapp.com/

To run this application locally:

1. You need to have Java and Java SDK installed on your machine. You can check your system for both with the command :
```
$ java -version
```
If not present, download online.

2. install Maven dependency manager and PostgreSQL are required. To install using homebrew:
```
$ brew install maven
$ brew install postgresql
```
3. Navigate to the directory in which you would like the project to be located in and clone the repository and navigate into the project file:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TyMazey/workoutService
$ cd workoutService
```
4. Check for an existing PostgresQL user named 'postgres' (exit postgres with '\q'):
```
$ psql
$ \du
```
If no 'postgres' user exists, run the command (from within psql):
```
$ /usr/local/opt/postgres/bin/createuser -s postgres
```
Once created, create a local development database (from within psql, ending semicolon is required):
```
$ CREATE DATABASE workoutService;
```

6. Install dependencies and build the app with:
```
$ mvn install
```
Once this setup is complete, you can run the app locally with the command:
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
And navigate to:
```
$ http://localhost:5000
```
